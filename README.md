# ROS2_joystick_controlled_robot
I developed a real two-wheeled robot controlled via a joystick using ROS 2, Arduino and Raspberry. The robot utilizes ROS 2 nodes for real-time communication, enabling control and navigation. The robot also provide a first person view of what he sees, thank to an ESP32, streaming all on my PC.
