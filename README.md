# ROS2_joystick_controlled_robot
I developed with my team a real two-wheeled robot controlled via a joystick using ROS 2, Arduino and Raspberry. The robot utilizes ROS 2 nodes for real-time communication, enabling control and navigation. The robot also provide a first person view of what he sees, thank to an ESP32, streaming all on my PC.

Components:
  -Raspberry Pi4
  -Arduino UNO
  -Brushless DC Motors
  -L298N motor drivers
